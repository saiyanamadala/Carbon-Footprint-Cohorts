# Carbon-Footprint-Cohorts

The Carbon Footprint Cohort project undertook a comprehensive analysis of emissions data spanning various countries across multiple years. The primary objective was to gain a deeper understanding of the global carbon emissions landscape and to employ clustering techniques for categorizing countries based on their emission levels.

**Key Components:**

1. **Data Gathering:**
   The project meticulously collected extensive data on carbon emissions, encompassing various sources such as gases, coal, oil, and cement, spanning numerous countries over an extensive time frame.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   Rigorous exploratory data analysis was conducted to discern distribution patterns, trends, and underlying insights within the emissions dataset. Utilizing tools like pandas and numpy facilitated efficient data manipulation and transformation, crucial for preliminary analysis.

3. **Clustering Analysis:**
   The project utilized the k-means clustering algorithm to effectively segment countries into distinct groups based on their emission levels. This clustering methodology enabled the categorization of countries into low, medium, and high emission cohorts, thereby providing deeper insights into global emission trends.

4. **Visualization:**
   Visualizations were created using tools such as matplotlib and seaborn to showcase the findings derived from both exploratory data analysis and clustering analysis. A diverse range of graphs and plots were crafted to visually illustrate emission trends, cluster distributions, and comparative analyses across countries and emission types.

**Key Findings:**

- Identified countries with similar emission profiles and categorized them into low, medium, and high emission categories based on their carbon footprint.
- Unveiled insights into the distribution of emissions across various sectors (e.g., gas, coal, oil) and their respective contributions to overall carbon emissions.
- Highlighted discernible trends and patterns in emission levels over time, providing valuable insights for informed decision-making and policy formulation towards carbon mitigation strategies.

**Tools Used:**
- Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- Machine learning: k-means clustering algorithm

**Outcome:**

The Carbon Footprint Cohort project yielded invaluable insights into the global carbon emissions landscape, bolstered by the effective categorization of countries based on their emission levels. These findings serve as a foundation for understanding and addressing the complexities of the carbon footprint, thereby informing strategic policy decisions aimed at mitigating climate change on a global scale.
